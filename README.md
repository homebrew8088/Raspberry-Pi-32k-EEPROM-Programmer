This is a repository for my Rapberry Pi 32k EEPROM Programmer.

The [code](https://github.com/homebrew8088/Raspberry-Pi-32k-EEPROM-Programmer/tree/main/py) is written in python. To run it from the command line type "python3 32k.py"

I have included my [Kicad Files](https://github.com/homebrew8088/Raspberry-Pi-32k-EEPROM-Programmer/tree/main/Kicad) where you can find the schematics and PCB layout.

This was developed to be a cheap alternative for writing 32k EEPROMs for my 8088 projects. You can compile and upload code in the application or just upload a precompiled file.  When using the application to compile the JMP code for an 8088 is automatically inserted at address 0x7FF0.  

The project uses\
1 - Raspberry PI\
2 - MCP23S17 SPI I/Oâ€™s\
1 - 28 pin ZIF\
1 - PCB\
3 - 10k resistors 

Trouble shoot \
-make sure SPI is enabled on the raspberry pi \
-install nasm on the raspberry pi
